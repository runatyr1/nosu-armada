/**
 * Sign the LAST account out: wipe every trace of it and land on the login
 * screen. The counterpart to `signOutAccount`/`persistAndReload`, which handle
 * an exit that leaves other accounts mounted.
 *
 * The design point is that the reload is a GUARANTEE, not a consequence of
 * teardown finishing. Two things make it one:
 *
 *  - The logged-out state is made durable UP FRONT — the login list is written
 *    empty directly (as `persistAndReload` does, and for the same reason:
 *    `removeLogin` dispatches a reducer that persists from an effect, which a
 *    reload can tear down mid-flight and resurrect the session). So a reload
 *    triggered by the deadline below, before purge even runs, still boots
 *    logged out.
 *  - Navigation fires on an absolute {@link EXIT_NAV_DEADLINE_MS} deadline no
 *    matter what the teardown does. That is what a native `wipe()` bridge that
 *    never answers can no longer hang forever on, and it caps the whole
 *    operation whatever else stalls. The teardown races it and, on the happy
 *    path, wins — navigating the moment purge resolves.
 *
 * Everything between is best-effort and reported to the exit overlay as it
 * runs, so the wait names what it is doing.
