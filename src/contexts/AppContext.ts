 * out of DMs entirely — the settings UI warns about this).
 *
 * This is a CLIENT-SIDE helper only. The app DM relays are never written into
 * the user's published kind-10050 inbox (that event holds only the user's own
 * relays); they're just where this client also reads/writes DMs and points the
 * push/native watch sets. Because an Armada sender publishes the recipient's
 * gift wrap to its own effective set too (see useDm17), Armada↔Armada delivery
