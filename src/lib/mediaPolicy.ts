/**
 * Where a piece of remote media is loaded FROM, decided in one place.
 *
 * An `<img>` is a request from the viewer's own address to whichever host the
 * sender named, so a message containing an image is a message that learns the
 * IP of everyone who scrolls past it. Nothing about the bytes distinguishes a
 * picture from a logger, and no referrer policy or CSP touches the TCP
 * connection. The one control is a PROXY: a URI template (`{href}`, Ditto's
 * convention) that makes the proxy's address the one the sender's host sees.
 * This module owns that decision for chat attachments, avatars, custom emoji,
 * link-preview thumbnails and the encrypted Concord icons alike; the hooks and
 * the native ports apply it, they do not restate it.
 *
 * OFF by default — the app config ships an empty template, so media loads
 * directly from the host the sender named until the user turns proxying on in
 * settings, which sets the public proxy Ditto ships (a byte-for-byte
 * pass-through so ciphertext, hash-verified blobs and range requests all
 * survive it), itself replaceable. An empty template is proxying off. A
 * loopback/private address is never proxied (a public proxy cannot reach it)
 * and never loaded directly (it trips Chrome's Local Network Access prompt), so
 * it resolves to nothing.
 *
 * A policy may instead carry a POOL of proxy templates (`proxies`), parsed from
 * the user's list of proxies entered in settings (one per line, see
 * `parseProxyList`). The web client's cross-server fallback
 * (`routeMediaCandidates`) then rotates a URL across the pool — spreading which
 * proxy sees a given image, and falling to the next when one fails to load.
 * `proxy` is still the single-value floor the single-image sites (`mediaSrc`)
 * and the background writers read (they do not rotate); it holds the pool's
 * first entry.
 *
 * Pure. The Kotlin and Swift ports (`MediaPolicy.java`, `MediaPolicy.swift`)
 * apply the same rule to the background avatar fetch; keep the three in step.
 * They do NOT rotate — they carry the primary proxy only — but the template
 * normalization (`normalizeProxy`) is shared and must stay identical.
