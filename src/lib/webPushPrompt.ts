/**
 * Bridges the app-wide web-push hook to the post-login wizard so a fresh
 * web/PWA user is offered a one-time notification opt-in.
 *
 * Web Push is opt-out and auto-syncs on every load, but a brand-new user sits at
 * Notification permission `"default"` — and the browser refuses to grant
 * permission without a user gesture, which a headless auto-sync doesn't have. So
 * without an explicit ask, a fresh user never gets push until they hunt down the
 * Settings toggle. On iOS this is the *only* way in: the Push API exists solely
 * for a Home-Screen PWA, and it likewise needs the tap.
 *
 * The same gap, and the same fix, applies where Web Push is UNAVAILABLE and the
 * in-page notifier is all there is: its intent defaults to on, so it looks
 * enabled from the first launch while permission sits at `"default"` and it can
 * never fire. One step serves both — see {@link OptInMode}.
 *
 * The heavy push hook (`useNostrPush`) is already mounted once, app-wide, by
 * `WebPushNotifications`. Rather than mount a second
 * copy inside the wizard (doubling every subscribe/register), that single
 * instance drives this module: it keeps the live `enable` action current
 * (`setWebPushEnable`) and, when a fresh logged-in user could receive push,
 * calls `requestWebPushOptIn()`. `LoginSetup` registers an opener that surfaces
 * the step; the step's button runs `runWebPushEnable()` (the tap that grants
 * permission).

 * Armada is open. The step's copy has to say which, because "even while it's
