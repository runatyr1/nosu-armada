 * The origin shareable links are built on (#44).
 *
 * In the browser the page's own origin is correct: the link resolves back to
 * this deployment (including localhost/LAN quickstart installs, whose links
 * are meant to stay on that deployment). In the Capacitor APK, however,
 * `window.location.origin` is the WebView's local server (`https://localhost`)
 * — invite/share links built from it are dead on arrival for everyone they're
 * sent to.
 *
 * The Electron shell has the same problem for the same reason: it serves the
 * bundled SPA over its own `app://armada` scheme, which exists only inside
 * that process.
 *
 * Those builds therefore use the public web deployment, which doubles as the
 * app's verified App Links domain (see `client/android/.../AndroidManifest.xml`
 * and `lib/deepLinkUrl.ts`): recipients WITH the app open it directly, and
 * recipients without it land on the hosted web client. Operators can override
 * at build time with `VITE_PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN`.
