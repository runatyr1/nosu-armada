 *
 *   0. The signer can't prompt (a local nsec decrypts instantly, no approval) →
 *      proceed. There is nothing to gate: the consent prompt only exists to
 *      spare remote (NIP-46 bunker) / extension (NIP-07) signers a storm of
 *      per-decrypt approvals.
 *   1. Already allowed → proceed (the common steady state).
 *   2. Every target is already cached → proceed silently. A cached decrypt
 *      never touches the signer, so there's nothing to prompt about; this is
 *      what lets a warm client (re-entering a thread, a reconnect) skip the
 *      gate entirely.
 *   3. Otherwise consult the one-time consent gate (`ensureDecryptConsent`),
 *      which opens at most ONE app-wide prompt and remembers the answer.
 *
 * Returns true iff the caller should perform the (uncached) decrypts. When it
 * returns false the caller must leave the content as encrypted placeholders and
 * expose the manual "Decrypt" / "Decrypt all" affordances.
