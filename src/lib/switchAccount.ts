 * module-level memo maps, fold caches, open relay subscriptions. Changing it in
 * place left the incoming account looking at the outgoing one's DM list and
 * communities, which is the leak this exists to close. A reload is the only
 * teardown that is complete by construction, and it costs a cold boot on an
 * action users take rarely and already expect to be disruptive.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT rely on `setLogin`/`removeLogin` to persist. Those
 * dispatch a reducer and write from an EFFECT (`storage.setItem` in
 * `NostrLoginProvider`), which is both async and not guaranteed to have run
 * before `location.assign` tears the page down — a switch that reloads into the
 * account it just left. Writing the list here and awaiting it makes persistence
 * a precondition of the reload instead of a race against it. Nothing else
 * writes this key while the account menu is open, so there is no lost update.
 *
 * The `activeAccount` marker is set synchronously after login persistence, so
 * the next boot's very first render picks the incoming account's scoped config
 * and follower tabs cannot reload before the new login order is durable.
