/**
 * DM call signaling (see `src/lib/dmCall.ts` for the wire scheme). Owns:
 *
 *   - OUTGOING: `startCall` mints the per-call secret, resolves a blind
 *     broker, publishes the gift-wrapped "offer" (the ring signal), joins the
 *     room, and rings back until the peer answers — or times out after
 *     {@link DM_CALL_RING_MS} with an "end" so the peer's ring stops too.
 *   - INCOMING: a fresh offer from a KNOWN DM peer (one the user follows,
 *     has messaged/accepted, or pinned — the same `useKnownDmPeers` set the
 *     inbox/request split uses, muted peers excluded) rings a full-screen
 *     overlay (Accept / Decline) with a looping ringtone. The gate is on
 *     purpose: the offer's author controls their name and avatar, so a cold
 *     stranger must not be able to make a phone ring on demand — their offer
 *     is dropped silently and the conversation itself still shows their
 *     messages in the request tier. A known caller who arrives while the user
 *     is already in another call gets a passive "Missed call" notice rather
 *     than vanishing. Muting a peer silences their calls like everything else.
 *   - The signal fold: "answer" stops the caller's ringback (and, as an own
 *     self-copy, other devices' ringing); "decline" ends the caller's attempt;
 *     "end" is both cancel-while-ringing and hangup — while connected to that
 *     call it hangs up this side too, which is what makes a 1:1 call END when
 *     either party leaves rather than stranding one person in an empty room.
 *
 * Mounted inside CallProvider (it drives joinDmCall/leaveCall) and inside the
 * router (the Android incoming-call notification's Answer action deep-links
 * `/dm/<peer>?call=<id>`, which accepts the matching offer — one already in
 * hand, or the one the service vetted before it rang). The URL names a call
 * and authorizes nothing; see the deep-link effect below.
