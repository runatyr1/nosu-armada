/**
 * The dozen pictures offered to somebody who has just made an account.
 *
 * A dozen is the size of the thing, not a count of what happens to be in the
 * list: a new picture DISPLACES a placeholder rather than joining it, so the
 * grid stays the one screenful of choices it was meant to be. The length is
 * pinned in `ProfileStep.test.tsx` so adding a thirteenth is a failing test
 * rather than a slightly longer scroll.
 *
 * They exist because the alternative first thing a new account does is
 * nothing: a profile with no picture is the one everybody has, and a wall of
 * grey circles is how a network looks empty. One tap is a low enough price for
 * a face, and the pictures are ordinary enough that nobody is stuck with a
 * personality they did not choose.
 *
 * Every one of them is a URL on a Blossom server and nothing else. No picture
 * here is in the bundle, in this repository, or in its history, and choosing
 * one moves no bytes: the URL is what goes into the kind 0 verbatim. The
 * alternative — a file under `public/avatars`, uploaded to the new account's
 * own Blossom server at signup — is what this used to be, and it made a copy
 * of every preset in the app, in git forever, and on whatever server each new
 * account happened to be pointed at.
 *
 * What that costs, and it is worth naming: a published `picture` now points at
 * a blob nobody but its host is keeping. If one is dropped there, every
 * profile that chose it loses its picture, where a copy on the user's own
 * server would have survived. Inside Armada a miss is retried against the
 * user's Blossom servers by hash ({@link Avatar}'s source walk, which is why
 * these must stay content-addressed URLs — the hash IS the recovery); in
 * another client it is an ordinary URL on a host Soapbox runs.
 *
 * The ones with an artist in the `label` were submitted, and they lead the
 * list. The `PLACEHOLDER` rows behind them are Signal's, rendered out of the
 * vector drawables in Signal-Android (`res/drawable/ic_avatar_*.xml`) onto the
 * pastel backgrounds its own `AvatarColor` table pairs them with, in the order
 * `Avatars.kt` lists them, and they are being replaced one at a time as
 * artwork comes in — each submission costing whichever of them it stands in
 * for, which is the whole of how this list gets shorter on Signal's side and
 * no longer overall.
 *
 * LICENSING, because those are not Soapbox's: Signal-Android is GPL-3.0, which
 * AGPL-3.0-or-later may be combined with — so the web and F-Droid builds were
 * always fine, and no build contains the artwork at all now that these are
 * links. That is not the whole of the question the STORE builds raise, which
 * rests on the section 7 additional permission in the README's License section
 * and which Soapbox can only grant for copyright it holds (see AGENTS.md: no
 * copyleft artwork you don't own may enter a store build unless its holder has
 * granted the same permission): the app still offers Signal's pictures as its
 * own presets and Soapbox still hosts them. Replacing the placeholders with
 * art Soapbox has permission for is the fix, as it always was.
